# Carrier Java - V2

Elastos Carrier is a decentralized and encrypted peer-to-peer (P2P)  communication framework that facilitates network traffic routing between virtual machines and decentralized Applications (dApps).  Carrier Java is a Java distribution designed to run on VPS servers with a public IP address, serving as a super Carrier Node service.

Carrier V2 is a new two-layered architecture that features a unified DHT network as the bottom layer and facilitates various application-oriented services on top of the DHT network, where a list of services includes, but is not limited to:

- An active proxy service forwards the service entries from third-parties originally located within a LAN network, making them accessible from the public;
- A federal-based decentralized communication system provides great efficiency and security, including similar features to Carrier V1;
- A content addressing based storage system allows the distribtion of data among peers for the application scenarios like P2P file sharing.

**Notice**:  *the later two features have not been developed yet, but they are already included in the TODO List*.

### The Strengths of Carrier V2 Compared to Carrier V1

**Carrier V2** is an improved and entirely new version from the **CarrierV1** (Classic version), with the main differences listed below:

- CarrierV1 is a fully decentralized, secure P2P  communication system with friend-to-friend messaging capabilities, therefore it has a narrow adoption oriented towards IM-like platforms;
- Carrier V1 only includes messaging and session layers without a DHT-level network layer, while V2 has an independent DHT network that allows for greater scalability;
- By utilizing the DHT network on CarrierV2, group messaging and offline messaging can be achieved with great efficiency and enhanced features
